# Thapar

***LINUX USERS***
If you have pip installed and configured, the Linux_init.py file will automatically install the required packages. Otherwise, install the following packages using terminal
  1. python-mechanize
  2. python-bs4
These are needed for smooth execution. Please note that python is generally installed on your OS.

Run the Linux_init.py file by typing the following commands in your terminal
  python Linux_init.py
The script shall attempt to install the required packages using pip. If it fails, install the said packages manually
The script shall ask for the Webkiosk Username and Password. Both these shall appear in plain text here, so make sure that you enter this data in a discrete place

Now, you will be using Linux.py file. It has two dependency text files, namely
  data_webkiosk-thapar.txt
  history_webkiosk-thapar.txt
Make sure these files are always in the same directory as Linux.py.
Now run the script and relax, you shall be notified whenever a new score is uploaded. You may even add this to autostart on boot
